### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Writing the code for the HTML correctly is so important! I had some trouble making the focus state text to change color until I realised that I did'nt wrap the whole of the apps in the anchor tag.

### Continued development

I want to be more comfortable with HTML and CSS in general.
